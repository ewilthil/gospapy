    """ GOSPA metric for multitarget tracking filters.
    
    The algorithm is of course symmetric and can be used for any pair of
    comparable sets, but the labels 'targets' and tracks' are used to denote
    them as this is one of the most common applications.

    Returns the total GOSPA, the target-to-track assignment and the decomposed
    contribution of assignment errors, missed targets and false tracks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : iterable of elements
        Contains the elements of the first set.
    tracks : iterable of elements
        Contains the elements of the second set.
    c : float
        The maximum allowable localization error, and also determines the cost
        of a cardinality mismatch.
    p : float
        Order parameter. A high value of p penalizes outliers more.
    alpha : float, optional
        Defines the cost of a missing target or false track along with c. The
        default value is 2, which is the most suited value for tracking
        algorithms.
    assignment_cost_function : function, optional
        This is the metric for comparing tracks and targets, referred to as
        d(x,y) in the reference. If no parameter is given, euclidian distance
        between x and y is used.

    Returns
    -------
    gospa : float
        Total gospa.
    assignment : dictionary
        Contains the assignments on the form {target_idx : track_idx}.
    gospa_localization : float
        Localization error contribution.
    gospa_missed : float
        Number of missed target contribution.
    gospa_false : float
        Number of false tracks contribution.
